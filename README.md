# Ticket System Full Stack Application

This is a full stack application for managing tickets, built with Next.js and Supabase. It includes features for creating, viewing, and managing tickets, as well as user authentication.

This is a part of my progress in Packt Publishing's [Building Production-Grade Web Applications with Supabase](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Production-Grade-Web-Applications-with-Supabase) book.
